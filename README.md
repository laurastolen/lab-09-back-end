**Author**: Laura Antonius

**Version**: 1.0.4

## Overview
This is an application that allows a user to enter the name of a location (eg, Seattle), and gives an output of information (such as weather, Yelp, and other data) specific to that location. This information is obtained via superagent and returned using the express library and node.js runtime environment.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
In order to run this app, a user needs to have node.js installed. Required libraries include cors, express, superagent, and dotenv

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
12/12 - location and weather routes functioning to return Google and Dark Skies API info
12/13 - postgres db functioning to retain unique location names and latitude/longitudes
